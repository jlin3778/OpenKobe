## Disclaimer

OpenKobe's feedback is based on the personality that I have created for him, which is missing a big part of his human side, where he is a kind, loving father and has many great bonds with all his opponents on the basketball court. All his feedback will be given by the killer instinct side that is relentless in the pursuit of greatness.
